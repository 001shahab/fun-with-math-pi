## üåü Overview

This interactive visualization suite demonstrates the fascinating emergence of œÄ (pi) through six different mathematical methods simultaneously. It creates a stunning visual experience that showcases how this fundamental constant appears across various branches of mathematics - from geometry to probability theory to infinite series.

## üéØ Features

### Six Simultaneous œÄ Calculation Methods:

1. **Monte Carlo Method** - Statistical approach using random sampling
2. **œÄ Circle Pattern** - Overlapping circles creating geometric patterns
3. **Archimedes Polygon Method** - Classical geometric approximation
4. **Buffon's Needle Problem** - Probability-based calculation
5. **œÄ Cardioid Pattern** - Geometric pattern visualization (n=314)
6. **œÄ Digits Spiral** - Artistic visualization of œÄ's decimal expansion

### Visual Design:
- Light blue background for a calming, educational atmosphere
- Dark color scheme for better contrast and readability
- Smooth animations with interactive pause/resume functionality
- **Continuous animations**: Both circle and cardioid patterns loop infinitely, showing the emergence of patterns over time

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy 1.24.3
- Matplotlib 3.7.1
- SciPy 1.10.1 (optional, for enhanced calculations)

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pi-visualization.git
cd pi-visualization
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Usage

Run the visualization:
```bash
python pi_visualization.py
```

### Controls:
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Click to pause or resume all animations
- **Close**: Use the window's close button or press 'Q' to exit

## üî¨ Mathematical Methods Explained

### 1. Monte Carlo Method
- **Principle**: Randomly throws points in a square with an inscribed circle
- **Formula**: œÄ ‚âà 4 √ó (points inside circle) / (total points)
- **Visualization**: Dark blue dots (inside), Dark red dots (outside)

### 2. œÄ Circle Pattern
- **Concept**: Multiple overlapping circles arranged in a circular pattern
- **Animation**: Circles appear one by one, creating a flower-like pattern
- **Geometry**: 20 circles of radius 1, centers placed on a circle of radius 1
- **Pattern**: Creates a mandala-like design that relates to œÄ through circle geometry
- **Visualization**: Dark green circles appearing sequentially, then resetting for continuous animation

### 3. Archimedes Polygon Method
- **Principle**: Approximates a circle using regular polygons
- **Process**: As polygon sides increase, perimeter approaches 2œÄ
- **Visualization**: Dark golden polygon inscribed in a circle

### 4. Buffon's Needle Problem
- **Setup**: Drop needles on parallel lines spaced 1 unit apart
- **Probability**: P(crossing) = 2/(œÄ) for needle length = 1
- **Formula**: œÄ ‚âà 2 √ó (total needles) / (crossing needles)
- **Visualization**: Dark magenta (crossing), Dark gray (not crossing)

### 5. œÄ Cardioid Pattern
- **Concept**: Creates a cardioid/spirograph pattern using modular arithmetic
- **Animation**: Lines are drawn one by one, showing the pattern emerge
- **Method**: Connects points on a circle where each point i connects to point 2i mod n
- **Pattern**: With n=314 points, creates a beautiful heart-shaped curve
- **Visualization**: Dark red lines appearing sequentially, creating an intricate geometric pattern that loops infinitely

### 6. œÄ Digits Spiral
- **Concept**: First 100 digits of œÄ arranged in a spiral
- **Color Coding**: Each digit (0-9) has a unique color from the viridis colormap
- **Size**: Digit value determines point size

## üé® Customization

You can modify various parameters in the code:

```python
# In pi_visualization.py

# Change figure size
self.fig = plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10), facecolor='lightblue')

# Adjust animation speed
anim = animation.FuncAnimation(self.fig, self.animate, interval=50)

# Modify number of points per frame (Monte Carlo)
for _ in range(10):  # Change 10 to adjust speed

# Change color schemes
circle = Circle((0, 0), 1, fill=False, color='darkblue', linewidth=2)

# Adjust cardioid pattern points
self.cardioid_n = 314  # Change to create different patterns
```

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **Reduce Points**: For slower systems, reduce the number of points added per frame
2. **Adjust Interval**: Increase animation interval for smoother performance
3. **Limit Needles**: Set a maximum number of needles in Buffon's method

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **ImportError**: Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

2. **Slow Performance**: 
   - Close other applications
   - Reduce figure size in the code
   - Increase animation interval

3. **Display Issues**:
   - Update matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib --upgrade`
   - Check your display backend: `python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.get_backend())"`
